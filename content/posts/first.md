### Chapter 1: The Crucial Mental Shift: Overcoming America's Broken Financial Paradigm

#### Summary

Before pursing the Strait Path, we **get** to change our mindset from an accumulator mindset to an investor mindset.

Why should we change our mindset?

The accumulator mindset focuses on safety, stability, and avoiding risks. They do this by relying on one source of income and placing long, slow, "safe" bets.

The investor mindset focuses on generating cashflow. Hard cash that increases overall income, rather than fighting to maintain a current lifestyle up until retirement.

Investors are problem solvers who love learning through practical experience.

Because they are so resourceful from the habit of experience, they have a habit of seeing how to make the most out of anything, hence their proclivity to recognize opportunity from anywhere.

The two core beliefs that enable an investor mindset are always choosing the right attitude at the beginning of any endeavor, and by taking action now, regardless if it's perfect.

The end result of someone with an investor mindset is someone who gets to choose when they want to work, how they want to spend their time, and ultimately, confidence and enthusiasm that comes from acton.

#### Chapter Details

The goal of investing is to have cash flow--you are free when you have assets that put money into your pocket.

That's why buying a house, and paying off the mortgage too early, can be an issue--what you gain in peace of mind you sacrifice in investing into other assets.

But peace of mind is an illusion; if you seek safety, you will be mislead.

Kris does believe that everyone *should* pay off their mortgage, *but* in the right order of doing so, while preventing premature retirement.

Investing is all about earning cashflow, and having control over that cashflow yourself through self-reliance--because no one will care more about your money than you.

The issue with traditional retirement vehicles, such as IRAs or 401(k)s, is that they may perform well in the long run, **BUT** they may perform poorly right when you're looking to cash out for retirement. That's what happened to elderly people in 2008 when they believed their IRAs would be safe forward. 

Moreover, we simply may not even have enough money to pull from our retirement accounts; contributing the maximum to an IRA for 50 years yields about $1million dollars, which is roughly a $50,000/yr payout. That's poverty living. And when you consider inflation, it's even worse.

Aside from the issue with paying off the mortgage too early, or putting your money into stocks, we also need to consider our own personal cashflow.

And this is where Kris mentions the difference between accumulators and investors.

Think of accumulators as the FIRE movement; they save diligently, counting on the market to bring us the returns we need, just until we have a large enough "nest egg" that will permit us to live off the interest.

Characteristics of accumulators:
1. They avoid risk
2. They rely on one or two household income sources
3. They wait for opportunity

The investor, on the other hand, is the opposite. Investors **create** opportunity by choosing the creative power of abundance, rather than waiting for the market to bring enough returns.

Characteristics of investors:
1. Self-reliant
2. Calculated risk taking
3. Choose to see opportunity and abundance, where others see risk and danger
4. Patient, but not passive
5. Lifelong student
6. Knows how to accomplish something that most people cannot do
7. Problem solvers; they are resourceful, and as a result, they see how to make the most out of anything, hence their proclivity to recognize opportunity.


Kris mentions that the difference between the accumulator and the investor is that the accumulator uses creative power to create **retirement**, while the investor use creative power to create **assets** that produce cashflow.

Accumulators seek retirement; the investors seek cashflow.

Investors operate in environments that are volatile, risky, and negative.

To facilitate the shift from accumulator to investor, Kris recommends two simple techniques:
1. Embracing the possibility attitude
2. Living the law of now

(1) is simply having control of your thoughts by choosing to see the positives. Positive people tend to attract more of what they want.

I personally struggled with positivity; the best remedy I found was Meditation + CBT. If you add a healthy, consistent routine of healthy eating and exercising, it will make positive thinking so much easier.

> **You will become wealthy to the degree that you can see abundance of options**

Personally, I used to think only dumb people were positive--but then I started seeing the returns from their lives, and I came to realize that the smartest thing I can do is to be positive and act dumb--or more like a lifelong student who has a veracious curiosity.

> It is our attitude at the beginning of a test which, more than anything else, determines it's successful outcome.

(2) is simply taking action. The world rewards action, and places special preference to imperfect action, because the feedback in quick and honest.

Better to make take action and fail, than to wait until it's perfect timing to act without any mistakes.

Why?

> **we learn more from bad decisions than from indecision**

Just as Alex Hormozi said, "80% of the work is simply showing up, but it's that *start* that most people delay.

Blue Bill thinking is believe that good things come to us if we wait--a more accurate and realistic core belief is that we get what we act for--even bad decisions help give us clarity on the next step

> Those who are afraid of making decisions are those who inevitably make the worst decisions because they have little *practical* experience to draw upon.

Living in the law of now requires **faith**

If you make mistakes, it will be mistakes born out of a willingness and desire to act when being complacent and conformant is easy.

The fundamental reality of the accumulator mindset is that it doesn't practically, realistically, and fundamentally, actually work in real life, because it based on theoretical purity on how the world *should* work

Wouldn't it be nice to stuff money into a retirement account, and never think of it again, and wake up 5 years from now a billionaire?

That's Blue Bill thinking Neo.

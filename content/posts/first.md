### Introduction

#### Summary


The six core elements for real estate investing are:
1. time
2. effort
3. risk
4. service
5. market conditions
6. profit

Profit should come from the purchasing of a home at a discount, rather than appreciation.

### Chapter 1: The Crucial Mental Shift: Overcoming America's Broken Financial Paradigm

#### Summary

#### Chapter Details

The goal of investing is to have cash flow--you are free when you have assets that put money into your pocket.

That's why buying a house, and paying off the mortgage too early, can be an issue--what you gain in peace of mind you sacrifice in investing into other assets.

But peace of mind is an illusion; if you seek safety, you will be mislead.

Kris does believe that everyone *should* pay off their mortgage, *but* in the right order of doing so, while preventing premature retirement.

Investing is all about earning cashflow, and having control over that cashflow yourself through self-reliance--because no one will care more about your money than you.

The issue with traditional retirement vehicles, such as IRAs or 401(k)s, is that they may perform well in the long run, **BUT** they may perform poorly right when you're looking to cash out for retirement. That's what happened to elderly people in 2008 when they believed their IRAs would be safe forward. 

Moreover, we simply may not even have enough money to pull from our retirement accounts; contributing the maximum to an IRA for 50 years yields about $1million dollars, which is roughly a $50,000/yr payout. That's poverty living. And when you consider inflation, it's even worse.

Aside from the issue with paying off the mortgage too early, or putting your money into stocks, we also need to consider our own personal cashflow.

And this is where Kris mentions the difference between accumulators and investors.

Think of accumulators as the FIRE movement; they save diligently, counting on the market to bring us the returns we need, just until we have a large enough "nest egg" that will permit us to live off the interest.

Characteristics of accumulators:
1. They avoid risk
2. They rely on one or two household income sources
3. They wait for opportunity

The investor, on the other hand, is the opposite. Investors **create** opportunity by choosing the creative power of abundance, rather than waiting for the market to bring enough returns.

Characteristics of investors:
1. Self-reliant
2. Calculated risk taking
3. Choose to see opportunity and abundance, where others see risk and danger
4. Patient, but not passive
5. Lifelong student
6. Knows how to accomplish something that most people cannot do
7. Problem solvers; they are resourceful, and as a result, they see how to make the most out of anything, hence their proclivity to recognize opportunity.


Kris mentions that the difference between the accumulator and the investor is that the accumulator uses creative power to create **retirement**, while the investor use creative power to create **assets** that produce cashflow.

Accumulators seek retirement; the investors seek cashflow.

Investors operate in environments that are volatile, risky, and negative.
